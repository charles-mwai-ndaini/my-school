     <h2 id="our">Our Challenge is Poverty</h2>
     <p>Poverty comes in all forms, physical, spiritual, emotional, relational, economic. It robs people of their basic needs— food, clean water, sanitation, healthcare, and education. It destroys hope, purpose, and self-worth. It infects hearts with isolation, apathy, dependency, disconnection, and addiction. Poverty is life fallen short of God’s intent.</p>
